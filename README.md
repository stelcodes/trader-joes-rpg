# Trader Joe's: The Text RPG
It's your first day at Trader Joe's. You want to make friends, but you seem to keep saying or doing the wrong thing!
Everyone wants to work for the greatest grocery chain in the world, but *do you have what it takes??*

## How to Play
This game is text based and meant to be played on a terminal. Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The easiest way would be to use a package manager like Homebrew on a Mac or apt/dnf/pacman on Linux. Open up a terminal, and run `git clone https://github.com/stelcodes/trader-joes-rpg && python3 start.py`. You'll probably want to make the terminal fullscreen as well.
