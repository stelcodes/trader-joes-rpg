# Trader Joe's: The End is Nigh
It's your first day at Trader Joe's. You want to make friends, but you seem to keep saying or doing the wrong thing!
Everyone wants to work for the best grocery chain in the western world, but *do you have what it takes?!?*

## How to Play
### Mac/Linux:
Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The easiest way would be to use a package manager like Homebrew for Mac, or apt for Linux. Open up the terminal, clone this repo, `cd` into `trader-joes/`, and run `python3 trader-joes.py`. Resize the window so it's big.

### Windows (untested):
Download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download this repo as zip, unzip it, and open trader-joes.py with Python3. Resize the window so it's big. If this doesn't work, there may not be a way to play it.
